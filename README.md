# Local Hack Day: Build - Write Code to Sort a List
To challenge myself, I decided to complete this challenge using a new language. To make it a bit more interesting, I implemented a few of the most common sorting algorithms and tracked the execution time of each.

# Prerequisites
This project requires the installation of [Go](https://golang.org)

# Getting Started
### Step 1. Clone the code into a fresh folder
```
git clone https://github.com/granaj91/go-sort.git
cd go-sort
```

### Step 2. Run the program
`go run sort.go`
